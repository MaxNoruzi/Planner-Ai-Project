# 🧠 STRIPS-Based AI Planner – Forward & Backward Search in Multiple Domains

This project is a Python-based STRIPS-style planning system that implements **forward** and **backward** search algorithms over multiple classic AI planning domains. It features reusable planning components, regression and progression, domain-independent action/state structures, and support for heuristics.

> Built for AI planning experiments, domain modeling, and educational purposes.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **STRIPS Planning Framework** (preconditions, add/delete lists)
- 🔄 **Forward Search** (with optional heuristic)
- 🔁 **Backward Search**
- 🧩 **Domain Independence** (easy to plug in new domains)
- 📦 Modular action/state handling
- 🧠 Simple heuristics: ignore-preconditions & ignore-delete-list
- 🧪 Predefined test cases for multiple domains
